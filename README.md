# workout

I keep my results from gym sessions in the Notes app in my iPhone ðŸ¤ª. I want to change that. I'm sure there are perfect existing apps for this, but I want to build something myself.

So, this is yet another app for me to build for learning purposes.

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Run

```sh
yarn start
```
